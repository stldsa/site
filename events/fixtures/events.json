With the deskilling and professionalization of many PMC occupations has much of it become part of the working class?  Was the PMC ever a distinct class at all?</div><div><br></div><div>Whatever we think of the class formation arguments put forward by Ehrenreich and Zweig we are left with some political questions principal among these: Does class position prefigure political orientation? Does the working class <em>by virtue of its position in the economy </em>hold a special place in struggles for democracy and socialism? To help us explore these questions I suggest two brief pieces with divergent conclusions, Peter Meiksins, \"<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_GqI8EW74a-J2P1LnympgUOyHxUfvvG2/view\">Beyond the Boundary Questions</a>,\" New Left Review I/157, May/June 1986, and Andre Gorz, \"<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LAeZnEmTrWzQB5KRSC4rxqRUNwzKy1Sv/view\">The New Agenda</a>,\" NLR I/184, November/December 1990. </div><div><br></div><div>It's entirely possible to have a fruitful discussion without reading all (or any!) of these pieces, but these are provided as potentially useful guideposts.</div>",

The primary goal of private ownership is profit, and when it interferes in the public sector, it seeks profit at the expense of the people.

Soon you will hear the first shots; soon the shout of rebellion will thunder from the throats of the oppressed ...Land and Liberty!\"</em></p><p>These were the words of Mexican revolutionary Ricardo Flores Magón printed in Regeneración, the bilingual anarchist newspaper published by the Magón brothers and their compañeros (commonly known as magonistas), on November 19th,1910, just one day before the Mexican Revolution began to radically transform world history. Magón, one of the political precursors to the Mexican Revolution, made this declaration not in Mexico, but in the U.S., where he had been living with other magonistas, in exile due to their radical activities. They originally fled to the Southwest U.S. and in 1904 propelled the group further away from the border, to St. Louis, Missouri.</p><p>While in St. Louis, the Magón brothers founded the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM, Mexican Liberal Party), which despite its name was a radical political organization rather than a party. Magón and his compañeros continued their agitation against the Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz and projected their anarchist vision of a world without bosses or borders.</p><p>Their organizing and bonds created during their time in St. Louis would lay the foundation for long-term relationships among the radical left in both Mexico and the United States. </p><p>Readings: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DbwNOWIzU8j3TuMQBJxE_qW_nPKCFxpS?usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DbwNOWIzU8j3TuMQBJxE_qW_nPKCFxpS?usp=sharing</a></p><p>Hope to see you on the 23rd! </p>",

Our format for the near future will be changing to having a monthly class, with each covering a new topic. This time around we'll be having a discussion about how private provision and ownership makes housing unaffordable and why the incentives of landlords and developers create rising rents alongside increasingly vacant homes. We will discuss why current reforms have failed to resolve the crisis and why we need to organize tenants and de-commodify housing to guarantee homes for all. Readings are as follows: </p><p><a href=\"https://www.affordablestl.com/summary\">Reading 1</a> - A recent study covering the housing supply in St. Louis.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent\">Reading 2</a> - This article covers the rise of rent-setting algorithms and how they've affected housing costs, as well as how landlords have been keeping houses vacant to maintain high prices. </p><p><a href=\"https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/an-east-boston-tenant-fought-her-eviction-for-8-years.-the-city-bought-her?utm_source=Next+City+Newsletter&utm_campaign=35e226603c-DailyNL_2023_03_09&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fcee5bf7a0-35e226603c-44407213\">Reading 3</a> - This reading gives an example of how Boston took action to curb speculation on housing by directly purchasing numerous properties.</p><p>I hope to see you there! These classes are open to everyone, so as always feel free to spread the word to anyone interested. Because this is a live event, please be sure and bring a mask as wearing one is mandatory while indoors. </p>",

For the June class we'll examine the scope and nature of forced labor in U.S. prisons, with a particular focus on socialist critiques of the prison-industrial complex (defined in contrast to the more common market economic critique of prison labor) and the longstanding movement to secure collective bargaining rights for incarcerated workers, one potential path for socialist resistance to mass incarceration. In addition to examining these issues nationally, we'll delve into Missouri Vocational Enterprises, the manufacturing arm of the Missouri Department of Corrections, to look at how prison labor impacts both incarcerated and non-incarcerated Missourians. Readings for this class can be found with the below links: </p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GVBBkFqObEu4TFPCMj5yH0s2VF2E26to/view?usp=sharing\">Reading 1:</a> The Prison Industrial Complex - An article covering the rise of \"for profit prisons\" and how incarceration has become a big business. </p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GUwBBom-ffF04RXuOtsjwmmCxhJw-tnM/view?usp=sharing\">Reading 2:</a> Union Organizing & Collective Bargaining for Incarcerated Workers - This reading covers opportunities for incarcerated workers to organize and push back against the exploitive conditions they live in. </p><p>I hope to see you there!

As always these classes are open to everyone, so if you know anyone that might be interested, be sure and let them know. </p><p> For the July class we'll be looking back to a seminal chapter of the history of the United States. No event in US history ruptured property relations as much as the abolition of slavery. The emancipation of 4 million Black slaves represented a significant break in the social order and an opportunity to rebuild a more democratic and just nation before it was tragically abandoned and left unfinished. Antislavery public opinion and democratic mass politics in the North along with mass resistance from the Black slaves led to the revolutionary upheaval that culminated in the abolition of slavery. In this class we will look at what can we, as democratic socialists, learn from this Second American Revolution?</p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxRAOZnxep-jIL6rtnL33D0qegnG_0-X/view?usp=sharing\">Reading 1</a><span></span> - \"The General Strike\" by W.E.B.

This month's class will be presented by journalist Devin O'Shea and will be covering the story of German Socialists in St. Louis! </p><div><font>Through lifting weights, drinking beer, and committing armed revolutionary emancipation, German immigrants had a profound effect upon politics and culture in St. Louis. Much of that history has been erased over the course of two world wars and the Red Scare. This lecture will provide an ideological overview of what socialism and communism meant in 1848, what distinguished Germans from other classes of immigrants arriving in America, the lasting socialist influence won in the aftermath of the American Civil War, and why the German influence on St. Louis and the Midwest is largely forgotten.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><p>Readings can be found below: </p><div><font>\"<a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2023/08/german-forty-eighters-immigrants-turners-exercise-socialists-abolitionists-civil-war\">Socialist Gym Rats Fought to End Slavery,</a>\" in <em>Jacobin</em></font></div><div><br></div><div><font><em></em></font>\"<a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2023/03/german-americans-civil-war-franz-sigel-st-louis\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">From Slavery Abolition to Public Education, German Radicals Made American History</a>,\" in <em>Jacobin</em></div><div><br></div><div><em></em>Devin O'Shea's writing is in <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/12/percy-green-st-louis-activism-veiled-prophet-ball-ellie-kemper.html\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><em>Slate</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/veiled-prophet-st-louis/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><em>The Nation</em></a>, <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2021/07/st-louis-commune-great-railroad-strike-1877-us-labor-history\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><em>Jacobin</em></a>, <a href=\"https://proteanmag.com/2021/09/22/the-busch-family-brood/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><em>Protean</em></a>,<a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/07/the-rot-of-the-st-louis-elite-goes-far-deeper-than-the-gun-couple\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"> <em>Current Affairs</em></a> and elsewhere. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/devintoshea\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">@devintoshea</a> on twitter, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/devintoshea\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">@devintoshea</a> on Instagram.</div>",

We have covered a number of diverse topics and I am proud of how so many in our chapter have lent their time and knowledge for the benefit of everyone. Don't worry though, SNS will return with new courses and material in early 2024! And there is still one class left!</p><p>Join us for the final SNS class of 2023, as we take a look at conspiracy theories in the United States. Widespread paranoia and mistrust has been a hallmark of our nation for its entire history, and you can look forward to a brief overview of how these theories have shaped the culture and behavior of it. After the overview we'll be going over individual theories as a group. Just a disclaimer, this is going to be a little more light-hearted class, and participants are strongly encouraged to share their favorite theories. The more outlandish the better, because everybody loves fringe weirdness. No readings required, and you can expect food and drinks to be served.</p>",
