Manifold DSA will occasionally be updated with new features and bug fixes.

To make sure you have the newest version (currently Manifold DSA 1.5) installed:

1. Uninstall and delete the current version, if the font is already installed. On Mac, use Font Book; on Windows, use the Fonts folder.

2. Reboot your machine.

3. Install the new version as usual.

If you encounter any strange behavior, ugly glyphs, or missing features, let us know so we can address the issues.

Thank you, and enjoy!
