## Before you begin

- Visit https://stldsa.org/updates/ and make sure you are logged in with your STL DSA account. If you are logged in, you will see a "myDSA" button in the upper right corner of the page. If you are not logged in, you will see a "Log In" button instead.

> For now, when you log in, you will be redirected to your myDSA page. [Issue 57](https://github.com/stldsa/site/issues/57) tracks implementation of a redirect to the page you were on before you logged in. If you needed to log in, navigate back to [Updates](https://stldsa.org/updates/).
